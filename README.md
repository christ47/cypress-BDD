# cypress-BDD

This framework consist of critical paths for the swag labs app. It consists of Typescript, Cypress and Cucumber.

## Usage

Run $ npm
To run test run $npx cypress run

## Limitations
Unfortunately, as saucedemo has issues working with cypress it is best to run this test headless. Code around web securities has been added to my cypress config in order to work around this issue. For more information on this visit the link below!
